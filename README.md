# elm-projector

Present Markdown slides as HTML. Built in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org). Heavily inspired by [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/1).

## Add your slides

Slides are expected to be defined in `slides.md`: each slide must start with a **Heading 1** (e.g. `# First slide`).

## Run

then go to [http://localhost:8000/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/Main.elm)
